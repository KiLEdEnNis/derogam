	description `The Assassin is the Derogam's main medium warship, although it has an unusual style; it's meant to be a fast ship with high firepower to take out priority targets. The Assassin was also the first ship to test a new so-called 'vein' technology which distributes various substances around the ship in the tubes around its hull. This gives the ship some extra utility in the form of a little hull and shield regeneration, converting some heat to energy, and unusually efficient heat dissipation, enabling it to take a very large amount of heat.`

	description `The Warrior's design is, as its look suggests, based on the Assassin; it was even the second ship to test the 'vein' technology for its successor, the Guardian. Because it is primarily serving as the Derogam's offensive heavy warship, the Warrior has a lot of weapon hardpoints, intended to enable a wide variety when outfitting it instead of filling all hardpoints at once. This means some are outfitted as torpedo ships while others use the turrets for raw damage instead.`
