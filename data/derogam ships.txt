	description `The Assassin is the Derogam's main medium warship, although it has an unusual style; it's meant to be a fast ship with high firepower to take out priority targets. The Assassin was also the first ship to test a new so-called 'vein' technology which distributes various substances around the ship in the tubes around its hull. This gives the ship some extra utility in the form of a little hull and shield regeneration, converting some heat to energy, and unusually efficient heat dissipation, enabling it to take a very large amount of heat.`
