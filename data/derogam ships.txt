	description `The Assassin is the Derogam's main medium warship, although it has an unusual style; it's meant to be a fast ship with high firepower to take out priority targets. The Assassin was also the first ship to test a new so-called 'vein' technology which distributes various substances around the ship in the tubes around its hull. This gives the ship some extra utility in the form of a little hull and shield regeneration, converting some heat to energy, and unusually efficient heat dissipation, enabling it to take a very large amount of heat.`

	description `The Warrior's design is, as its look suggests, based on the Assassin; it was even the second ship to test the 'vein' technology for its successor, the Guardian. Because it is primarily serving as the Derogam's offensive heavy warship, the Warrior has a lot of weapon hardpoints, intended to enable a wide variety when outfitting it instead of filling all hardpoints at once. This means some are outfitted as torpedo ships while others use the turrets for raw damage instead.`

	description `The Gatherer is designed to have high cargo capacity in reinforced pods that are quickly replaceable. This unusual design gives it a relatively weak hull and makes it quite slow, but for a small freighter it has a great amount of cargo space. Its armament consists of two small turrets intended to use two anti-missile systems.`

	description `The Collector is designed with big reinforced detachable cargo pods to quickly load and unload cargo. It also has good mobility for a freighter its size, improving its survivability and making it such a popular freighter. It's even commonly used in their military; the Hoarder's sheer size makes it an easy target, despite the stronger hull and shields, and the Gatherer is an easy target due to low survivability. Its armament is relatively weak, mainly meant to keep itself and other smaller ships safe, but in a group, even civilian ships make a strong enemy.`
