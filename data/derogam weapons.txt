	description `The Derogam Pestilence is designed solely as a support weapon to give enemy ships a disadvantage in combat. The beam consists of two components; one drains the target's energy, which disrupts its shields as well, while the other part uses that energy to slow down the target ship and overheat it while doing so. Its only downside is that it does no damage, but when paired with strong weapons it's a deadly combination.`
