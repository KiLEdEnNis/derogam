	description `The Derogam Pestillence is meant solely as a support weapon to give enemy ships a disadvantage in combat. Not only does it disrupt the target's shields, it also drains it's batteries doing so. This proces leaves a considerable amount of heat behind and even slows the target. It's only downside is that it does no damage, but when paired with strong weapons it's a deadly combination.`
