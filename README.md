# Important
All outfits are placeholders until I make MY OWN.

# The Derogam
This is my first actual Endless Sky project, and the goal is to add 2 new species to the game with this plugin. I'm hoping to merge this with the base game once done.


# Who/what the Derogam are

They're dragon-like aliens. They'll be very advanced, balanced around the Heliarch, Wanderers and Korath Automatons, with interesting, new, and hopefully original distinctions.

For example, the first weapon I made: the Pestillence Turret, it's meant to be a green/reddish laser beam that does not do any damage, but it gives the ship it hits several disadvantages. To keep it fun to fight them (or basically balanced as I only have a vague idea for the story) it'll be quite big and it will drain a lot of energy, meaning only big ships can actually utilize one. Some ships may even get small integrated bonus stats (from their "vein" technology: the orange tubes on larger warships), like a little energy generation, shield regeneration, hull repair or whatever.

# Who/what the Nekis are

Think of them as humanoid tigers. Throughout the story you'll basically learn that they're travelling searching for new systems, for who knows what reason. I won't spoil much else besides that they'll be an enemy in the story, but who knows, it may change?

# "Schedule"

GRADUATED HIGHSCHOOL (11 July 2017), got more time to work on my plugin

I am planning to make an initial map (I may move, edit and add stuff after I have it), so I have a "base" to work with. I will also make ships in-between (I'm going to start sketching ship ideas so I can make better ships faster; usually I mess around w/ breaks in between for weeks per ship, I'm also considering working on several ships at once).

SHIPS I'M WORKING ON: The last ship I finished was the Predator, the first Nekis ship. I'm not sure what ship I'll make next, it depends on what I feel like.

# Planned ships: (they have placeholder outfits until I made my own)

This does NOT mean I won't make more ships, maybe I will, it just means that this is the "core", after this I'll do other stuff first.

DEROGAM MILITARY SHIPS:
- 2 Heavy Warships (Derogam Warrior (implemented) and Derogam Guardian
- 1 Medium Warship (Derogam Assassin (implemented))
- 1 Light Warship (Derogam Sentry)
- 1 "Gunship" (Medium Warship) (Derogam Renegade); More guns, no turrets, agile, fragile, and will have 1-2 Fighters.
- 1 "Light Carrier" (Medium Warship) (Derogam Knight); Weak on its own.
- 1 "Heavy Carrier" (Heavy Warship) (Derogam Sentinel); Strong on its own.
- 1 Fighter (Derogam Prowler); durable like the Sestor fighters.
- 1 Interceptor (Derogam Rogue)

DEROGAM CIVILIAN SHIPS:
- 1 Small Transport (Derogam Disciple)
- 1 Medium Transport (Derogam Itinerant (implemented))

- 1 Large Hybrid (Derogam Amalgam)
- 1 Small Freighter (Derogam Gatherer (implemented))
- 1 Medium Freighter (Derogam Collector (implemented))
- 1 Large Freighter (Derogam Hoarder (implemented))

NEKIS MILITARY SHIPS:
- (a few planned already, but I'm not putting it here yet until I'm sure what ships I'll make)
- 1 Heavy Warship (Nekis Predator (implemented))

NEKIS CIVILIAN SHIPS:
- (a few planned already, but I'm not putting it here yet until I'm sure what ships I'll make)
