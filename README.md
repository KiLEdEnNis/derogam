# Important
All outfits are placeholders until I make MY OWN. Enjoy not reading the rest. :3

# The Derogam
This is my first actual Endless Sky project, and the goal is to add an entire new species to the game with this plugin. I hope that when I'm fully done with it it could actually be added to the game itself.


# Who/what the Derogam are

They're dragon-like aliens (which you can see from the first ship I made: the Derogam Assassin). They'll be very advanced aliens, balanced around the Heliarch, Wanderers and Korath Automatons, with interesting, new, and hopefully original distinctions.

For example, the first weapon I made: the Pestillence Turret, it's meant to be a greenish (projectile sprite not animated yet) laser beam that does not do any damage, but it gives the ship it hits several disadvantages. To keep it fun to fight them (or basically balanced as I only have a vague idea for the story) it'll be quite big and it will drain a lot of energy, meaning only big ships can actually utilize one. Some ships may even get small integrated bonus stats (from their "vein" technology: the orange tubes on larger warships), like a little energy generation, shield regeneration, hull repair or whatever.

# Schedule

SLOW DUE TO EXAMS COMING UP IN REAL-LIFE

At the moment I nearly finished my Medium Transport (Itinerant), after which I'll make the Small/Large Transports based on the Medium one

I try to finish my Transports as soon as possible (when I feel like working on them), I'd want them done mid-May but early May my exams start, so don't expect the Transports before end May

After I finished the Transports I will attempt to make the Hybrids, and then I will focus on the military ships (no order planned, I will make whatever I want).

After that I want to make some outfits to start replacing all temporary outfits. I'll work a bit all-round when I feel like it.

# What I'm currently working on: SHIPS (they have placeholder outfits until I made my own)

This does NOT mean I won't make more ships, maybe I will, it just means that this is the "core", after this I'll do other stuff first.

MILITARY SHIPS:
- 2 Heavy Warships (Derogam Warrior (implemented) and Derogam Guardian)
- 1 Medium Warship (Derogam Assassin (implemented))
- 1 Light Warship (Derogam Hunter)
- 1 "Gunship" (Medium Warship) (Derogam Renegade); More guns, no turrets, agile, fragile, and will have 1-2 Fighters.
- 1 "Light Carrier" (Medium Warship) (Derogam Knight); Weak on its own.
- 1 "Heavy Carrier" (Heavy Warship) (Derogam Sentinel); Strong on its own.
- 1 Fighter (Derogam Prowler); durable like the Sestor fighters.
- 1 Interceptor (Derogam Stalker)

CIVILIAN SHIPS:
- 1 Small Transport (Derogam Disciple) (next on schedule
- 1 Medium Transport (Derogam Itinerant) (in progress, nearly done)
- 1 Large Transport (Derogam Wayfarer) (next on schedule)
- 1 Small Hybrid (Derogam Mingling); Hybrids are Transports & Freighters in one
- 1 Medium Hybrid (Derogam Hybrid)
- 1 Large Hybrid (Derogam Amalgam)
- 1 Small Freighter (Derogam Gatherer (implemented))
- 1 Medium Freighter (Derogam Collector (implemented))
- 1 Large Freighter (Derogam Hoarder (implemented))
