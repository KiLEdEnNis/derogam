# The Derogam
This is my first actual Endless Sky project, and the goal is to add an entire new species to the game with this plugin. I hope that when I'm fully done with it it could actually be added to the game itself.


# The species

Since I couldn't really come up with a good name, I decided to go with an alien-ish name; the Derogam. They're dragon-like aliens (which you can see from the first ship I made: the Derogam Assassin). They'll be very advanced aliens, balanced around the Heliarch, Wanderers and Korath Automatons, with interesting, new, and hopefully original distinctions.

For example, the first weapon I made: the Pestillence Turret, it's meant to be a greenish (no projectile sprite yet) laser beam that does not do any damage, but it gives the ship it hits several disadvantages. To keep it fun to fight them (or basically balanced as I only have a vague idea for the story) it'll be quite big and it will drain a lot of energy, meaning only big ships can actually utilize one. Some ships may even get small integrated bonus stats, like a little energy generation, shield regeneration, hull repair or whatever.

# Currently working on

I'm currently working on adding new ships, and my plan is to add:
- 2 Heavy Warships; One will be the primary battleship (very rarely seen to escort a big civilian fleet), the other will be even stronger and will be their "flagship". 
- 1 Medium Warship (the Derogam Assassin); Meant to be their main warship, and will often lead small fleets. Sometimes used to defend their civilians.
- 1 Light Warship; A smaller ship meant to accompany bigger ships as escorts or lead very small fleets. Often used to defend their civilians.
- 1 "Gunship"; More guns, no turrets, agile, fragile, and will have 1-2 Fighters. Will be classified as Light or Medium Warship. Often used to defend their civilians.
- 1 "Light Carrier"; It will be very weak on it's own, which means low survivability, being slow and low armament. It'll be able to carry about 6-8 Fighters under 2 side "clamps", meaning the ship will be quite long and look fragile. Will be classified as Light or Medium Warship. To keep the Derogam from relying a lot on huge Fighter fleets, this ship will be relatively rare.
- 1 "Heavy Carrier"; This Carrier will be very tough, but slow and also lack armament (although it'll have enough to take on several smaller ships). It'll be able to carry about 10-12 Fighters, hopefully on top as a "deck". Will be classified as Heavy Warship. To keep the Derogam from relying a lot on huge Fighter fleets, this ship will be very rare.
- 1 (maybe 2) Fighters; they'll be quite strong with decent weaponry, maybe more tougher but slower than the Kor Sestor Fighters.
- 1 Interceptor; Meant to serve as patrol and scout ships, with a Light Warship to lead them. Often used to defend their civilians.

# Feedback

Please take a look and enjoy what I make, and give feedback even about the tiniest things like a typo, or an outfit/weapon that may seem too stromg.
