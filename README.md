# First
8 January 2019: My internship ends 24 January but I procrastinated some stuff, so either no work until February or I procrastinate more and make new planets & commodities for the map or something.

New graphics: Healing Core Size 3 Blend is done, needs GIMP, other 3 models are yet to be made.


# Important
All outfits that I didn't make myself are placeholders until I make my own (i.e. Bombardment Cannons and Korath engines will be replaced by mine).

# Derogam
My Endless Sky project. The goal is to add new alien species to the game with this plugin. Once I have enough content, the aim is to add it to the base game.


# Who/what the Derogam are
Dragon-like aliens (of course dragons). Very advanced, balanced around the Heliarch, Wanderers and Korath Automatons, with their own fancy unique tech.

Examples of fancy unique tech:
- Bigger military ships may have built-in shield/hull regen & power generation/battery
- Power generators with some shield regeneration
- Cooling that has both flat and active cooling

But also less fancy but still a bit unique:
- A torpedo that halts after firing, then speeds up again
- A beam that shoots for a few seconds, then pauses for a few


# Who/what the Nekris are
Imagine cat-like aliens (like Imperium Galactic War's Regula race). Throughout the story you'll basically learn that they're a travelling faction, searching for systems, possibly hostile to others.


# "Schedule"
Read the "queue" list & the "working on" list: https://trello.com/b/aM2pteNE/derogam


# Planned ships (bare minimum, will add more after)
- 9+ Military Derogam ships
- 9+ Civilian Derogam ships
- ?? Nekris ships

Darcy (https://github.com/Darcman99) for:
- being the diehard fan who motivates me not to be a lazy ass (without him you'd still have no map in December 2018)


Everyone that starred, watched and downloaded my project (doesn't matter much what you do, I just want people to be interested & to support this mod, although I do it more for myself).
