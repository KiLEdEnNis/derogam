# The Derogam
This is my first actual Endless Sky project, and the goal is to add an entire new species to the game with this plugin. I hope that when I'm fully done with it it could actually be added to the game itself.

The species;
Since I couldn't really come up with a good name, I decided to go with an alien-ish name; the Derogam. They're dragon-like aliens (which you can see from the first ship I made: the Derogam Assassin). They'll be very advanced aliens, balanced around the Heliarch, Wanderers and Korath Automatons, with interesting, new, and hopefully original distinctions.
For example, the first weapon I made: the Pestillence Turret, it's meant to be a greenish (no projectile sprite yet) laser beam that does not do any damage, but it gives the ship it hits several disadvantages. To keep it fun to fight them (or basically balanced as I only have a vague idea for the story) it'll be quite big and it will drain a lot of energy, meaning only big ships can actually utilize one. Some ships may even get small integrated bonus stats, like a little energy generation, shield regeneration, hull repair or whatever.

Please take a look and enjoy what I make, and give feedback even about the tiniest things like a typo, or an outfit/weapon that may seem too stronmg.
