All outfits are placeholders until I make MY OWN.

# The Derogam
This is my first actual Endless Sky project, and the goal is to add 2 new species to the game with this plugin. I'm hoping to merge this with the base game once done.


# Who/what the Derogam are

They're dragon-like aliens. They'll be very advanced, balanced around the Heliarch, Wanderers and Korath Automatons, with interesting, new, and hopefully original distinctions.

For example, the first weapon I made: the Pestillence Turret, it's meant to be a green/brownish laser beam that does no damage, but it gives the ship it hits several disadvantages (ion, heat, slowing AND disruption). To keep it fun to fight them (and balanced) it'll be quite big and drain a lot of energy, meaning only big ships can really utilize one without a full loadout to just use one. Some ships even get small integrated bonus stats (from their "vein" technology: the orange tubes on larger warships), like a little energy generation, shield regeneration, hull repair and battery.

# Who/what the Nekis are

Similar to humanoid tigers (cat-like people). Throughout the story you'll basically learn that they're travelling searching for new systems, for who knows what reason. I won't spoil much else besides that they'll be an enemy in the story... But who knows if they may become friendly?

# "Schedule"

I graduated highschool (11 July 2017), in college though but I should have enough time to work on the plugin.

An initial map lay-out has been made (I may move, edit and add stuff after I have it), but there are no planets, names or anything yet. As for ships; this is my main focus right now, and since the larger Derogam ships have been made and there are now smaller ones to make, it'll be easier to create them (meaning there'll be several ships released in a shorter time frame).

SHIPS I'M WORKING ON: After the Guardian was done, I decided to create the smaller base warships: right now the Sentry (Light Warship), after that I'll make the Rogue (Interceptor), then continue on either the civilian ships, or start on the carriers.

# Planned ships: (they have placeholder outfits until I make my own)

This does NOT mean I won't make more ships, maybe I will, it just means that this is the "core", after this I'll do other stuff first.

DEROGAM MILITARY SHIPS:
implemented:
- 1 Medium Warship (Derogam Assassin)
- 2 Heavy Warships (Derogam Warrior) (Derogam Guardian)

not implemented yet:
- 1 Light Warship (Derogam Sentry)
- 1 Interceptor (Derogam Rogue)
- 1 "Gunship" (Medium Warship) (Derogam Renegade); More guns, no turrets, agile, fragile, and will have 1-2 Fighters(??).
- 1 "Light Carrier" (Medium Warship) (Derogam Knight); Weak on its own.
- 1 "Heavy Carrier" (Heavy Warship) (Derogam Sentinel); Strong on its own.
- 1 Fighter (Derogam Prowler); durable like the Sestor fighters.

DEROGAM CIVILIAN SHIPS:
implemented:
- 1 Small Freighter (Derogam Gatherer)
- 1 Medium Freighter (Derogam Collector)
- 1 Large Freighter (Derogam Hoarder)
- 1 Medium Transport (Derogam Itinerant)

not implemented:
- 1 Small Transport (Derogam Disciple)
- 1 Large Transport (Derogam Wayfarer)
- 1 Small Hybrid (Derogam Mingling); Hybrids are Transports & Freighters in one
- 1 Medium Hybrid (Derogam Hybrid)
- 1 Large Hybrid (Derogam Amalgam)


NEKIS MILITARY SHIPS (more to be added):
implemented:
- 1 Heavy Warship (Nekis Predator)

not implemented:
- 1 Light Warship (Nekis Pillager)
- 2 Medium Warships (Nekis Striker) (Nekis Demolisher)
- 1 Heavy Warship (Nekis Executioner)

NEKIS CIVILIAN SHIPS:
- 1 Large Hybrid (Nekis Voyager); Lore-wise it's their biggest civilian ships for long journeys, compare in to Korath World-Ships but meant for travel (but actually balanced).
