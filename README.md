# The Derogam
This is my first actual Endless Sky project, and the goal is to add an entire new species to the game with this plugin. I hope that when I'm fully done with it it could actually be added to the game itself.


# The species

Since I couldn't really come up with a good name, I decided to go with an alien-ish name; the Derogam. They're dragon-like aliens (which you can see from the first ship I made: the Derogam Assassin). They'll be very advanced aliens, balanced around the Heliarch, Wanderers and Korath Automatons, with interesting, new, and hopefully original distinctions.

For example, the first weapon I made: the Pestillence Turret, it's meant to be a greenish (no projectile sprite yet) laser beam that does not do any damage, but it gives the ship it hits several disadvantages. To keep it fun to fight them (or basically balanced as I only have a vague idea for the story) it'll be quite big and it will drain a lot of energy, meaning only big ships can actually utilize one. Some ships may even get small integrated bonus stats, like a little energy generation, shield regeneration, hull repair or whatever.

# What I'm currently working on (a little fancy description for each ship)

I'm currently working on adding new ships, and my plan is to add:

MILITARY SHIPS:
- 2 Heavy Warships; One will be the primary battleship (very rarely seen to escort a big civilian fleet), the other will be even stronger and will be their "flagship". 
- 1 Medium Warship (the Derogam Assassin); Meant to be the main warship, it will often lead small fleets. Sometimes used to defend their civilians.
- 1 Light Warship; A smaller ship meant to accompany bigger ships as escorts or lead very small fleets. Often used to defend their civilians.
- 1 "Gunship"; More guns, no turrets, agile, fragile, and will have 1-2 Fighters. Will be classified as Light or Medium Warship. Often used to defend their civilians.
- 1 "Light Carrier"; It will be very weak on it's own, which means low survivability, being slow and low armament. It'll be able to carry about 6-8 Fighters under 2 side "clamps", meaning the ship will be quite long and look fragile. Will be classified as Light or Medium Warship. To keep the Derogam from relying a lot on huge Fighter fleets, this ship will be relatively rare.
- 1 "Heavy Carrier"; This Carrier will be very tough, but slow and also lack armament (although it'll have enough to take on several smaller ships). It'll be able to carry about 10-12 Fighters, hopefully on top as a "deck". Will be classified as Heavy Warship. To keep the Derogam from relying a lot on huge Fighter fleets, this ship will be very rare.
- 1 (maybe 2) Fighter(s); They'll be quite strong with decent weaponry, maybe tougher but slower than the Kor Sestor Fighters, designed to be able to withstand a lot of battles while still offering decent support.
- 1 Interceptor; Meant to serve as patrol and scout ships, with a Light Warship to lead them. Often used to defend their civilians.

CIVILIAN SHIPS:
- 1 Small Transport; The most basic civilian transport ship designed to take a few passengers to their destination. Small civilian ships will have little armament, to be able to protect itself or help other nearby ships when it can.
- 1 Medium Transport; A more advanced transport ship designed to take larger groups of civilians to multiple destinations at once. Medium civilian ships will have decent armament to protect itself or support other ships when needed.
- 1 Large Transport; The biggest transport ship, used to carry either a lot of civilians or a few special ones (in which case they will be accompanied by a strong military fleet). Large civilian ships will have good armament similar to a Medium Warship.
- 2 Small Freighters; One will be a hybrid (Transport+Freighter) that can take both cargo and passenger transport missions, the other will be a small cargo ship meant for quick specific transport missions.
- 2 Medium Freighters; One will be a hybrid that is commonly used to transport both cargo and passengers to destinations close to each other, the other will be a medium cargo ship commonly used to make multiple deliveries to destinations close to each other.
- 2 Large Freighters; One will be a hybrid designed to take on lots of different missions to all kinds of places, the other is used to transport large amounts of cargo, and is even used by the military when needed to bring supplies to the front line.

# Feedback

Please take a look and enjoy what I make, and give feedback even about the tiniest things like a typo, or an outfit/weapon that may seem too strong.
