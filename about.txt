A big WIP project of dragon aliens with their own ships, outfits, storyline, jobs and whatnot. Base game quality is the aim and merging it is the idea, so ships, outfits etc. that are done may be improved anytime. When is it done? When there's nothing to add anymore, and judged by my work speed, never. Even after a storyline there may be side stories to make, ships to add, outfits to make, maintenance to do etc.
